//This is the second project 

Yeah could have been made in a little more efficent way but time was a constraint so!!!

#Screens
All Cities have separate pages(files)

#NavBar and Hader have separate files for the sake of reusability

#Property page shows the single property card based on user selection

#Context provides common shared data using context api

#Used useState hook for setting ids

#Navigation main source in App.jsx

#And main.jsx is the render method

#data.js is the data file to mimic api data

//Do suggest improvements

!!!Thank you
